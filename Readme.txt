Walmart Sales Forecasting Project

A. Problem Statement
A retail store with multiple outlets across the country is facing challenges in managing inventory to match demand with supply. As a data scientist, the task is to derive useful insights from the data and create prediction models to forecast sales for the upcoming months/years.

B. Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to predict sales for Walmart stores for the next 12 weeks. The dataset includes historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores, considering factors like time, space, and holidays. The goal is to analyze how sales are impacted by time-based and space-based factors, particularly examining the influence of holidays on store sales.

C. Data Description
The dataset consists of historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores, with information on store location, week, and various other features. The challenge is to accurately predict sales and demand, considering factors like markdowns around holidays. The project aims to determine the factors affecting sales and analyze the impact of holidays on sales.

D. Data Pre-processing Steps and Inspiration
The data pre-processing involves cleaning, exploring, and visualizing the data. Key steps include handling missing values, converting date columns, and exploring data distribution. Visualization techniques are used to gain insights into the relationships between different variables.

E. Choosing the Algorithm for the Project
Various machine learning algorithms are explored for this regression problem. The algorithms considered include Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost. Random Forest and Decision Tree models show promising results based on feature importance.

F. Motivation and Reasons For Choosing the Algorithm
The motivation behind choosing Random Forest and Decision Tree models lies in their ability to capture complex relationships in the data. These models demonstrate better performance compared to Linear Regression and KNN for the given dataset.

G. Assumptions
Accurate sales forecasting requires additional information such as historical sales data, customer demographics, and store location. Machine learning models depend on relevant data for accurate predictions, and without it, forecasting is challenging.

H. Model Evaluation and Techniques
Time series forecasting models, such as those utilizing neural networks, are considered the most accurate for sales forecasting. However, in this project, the focus is on evaluating regression models like Random Forest and Decision Tree using metrics such as R2 Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

I. Inferences from the Same
Walmart can leverage machine learning to forecast sales accurately by considering historical sales data, customer demographics, and other influencing factors. Incorporating predictive analytics can help identify patterns, trends, and factors affecting sales, leading to more informed decisions regarding inventory, pricing, and marketing.

J. Future Possibilities of the Project
The project lays the foundation for future possibilities, such as implementing time series forecasting models for even more accurate predictions. It opens avenues for exploring additional features and refining models to enhance forecasting capabilities. The insights gained can inform strategies related to inventory management, pricing, and marketing for Walmart stores.
